            <h1 class="center">Who am I?</h1><hr><br>
            <p class="justify">I am James Deus Dea√±o Umali from Montalban, Rizal. I am 20 year old student from the
                Institute
                of Technology - Polytechnic University of the Philippines taking up a course of Diploma in Information
                Communication Technology.</p><br>
            <p class="justify">The story of how I ended up in programming is because of my cousin. It was the summer of
                2017, We were at the tricycle that night on our way home when she is suddenly talking about their
                computer subject. She said that they are learning HTML and how to create a website. I who knew nothing
                about website at that time was really amazed about her story. And then when I got home, I decided to
                search about HTML because I was really curious about it and wanted to learn more. From at that point I started searching on where to learn more about Web
                Development. I ended up signing up on a website where I learn more about creating a website.</p><br>
            <p class="justify">I take up ICT strand when I was in Senior Highschool in Polytechnic University of the
                Philippines to learn more about programming. At first I have no problem understanding the things that were being taught
                to us, but when I encountered database I was having a hard time understanding it.</p><br>
            <p class="justify">Now I am a 3 <sup>rd</sup> year student, I realized that maybe when I was in grade 12 -
                learning database
                was my limit and I was not ready for it. Now I can say that I may not the best, But I can say that I am
                now better compared to before.</p><br>
            <p class="justify">This is what I learned from my past experience <strong><i>"When things does not favor your
                        way and you
                        feel like giving up. You have to remind yourself that learning is not easy and it will take time
                        and
                        effort"</i></strong> </p>
